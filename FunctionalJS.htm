_


=== Where did this guy come from?
* Started as a Graphic Designer
** NO PROGRAMMING
* Moved to Web Design
** Images
** CSS
** HTML
* Picked up ASP Classic
* Forced to learn Javascript (HATED all of it!)
* Learned a little of these
** PHP4
** C# .NET 2.0
** Java
* Began to LOVE Javascript

=== About me - Joshua Kalis
Front-end engineer for @QuickenLoans and I love Javascript!

=== What are the bad parts of Javascript?
* Variables is free to be overwritten at any time
* Type coersion within equality checks are unreliable
* The "this" value can be tricky for n00bs
* Blocks are optional for control structures
* Switch fall-through
* The "arguments" object inside function calls
* Automatic semi-colon insertion
* The difference in function statements and expressions
* I rarely use these
** eval
** with
** continue
** Typed wrappers: new Boolean(true), new Number(9), new Array(), etc.
** new (necessary at times but abstracted away from users)
** void
* Unused reserved words
* Unicode
* The typeof operator is in accurate
* Floating point numbers: 0.1 + 0.2 !== 0.3
* The plus (+) operator doing double duty as addition and concatenation
* NaN... Nyan cat?
_


=== What is there to love about Javascript?
* Ubiquitous
** It's almost everywhere
** Setup is done for you
* Forgiving
** Making mistakes might still achieve the goal you want
** Easy to start programming
* Useful
** People like having interactive web pages
** Employable skill
* Multiparadigm
** Write however you want
* and more probably

<!-- 
    misc
        2 types of side effects
        the UNIX philosophy
            do one thing
            work together - composition
    Why is functional programming a good thing? What benefits can be gained?
        lazyness - write once, use over and over everwhere
        test-ability leads to confidence in the execution
        purity/referential transparency
            caching/memoizing
        reduced function length and complexity
    Traditionally in OOP functions (methods) must be a part of an object
        lamba expressions

=== Programming Paradigms
* Imperative (Proceedural, Structured)
* Object Oriented
* Functional
* Others - yes there are lots.
_


=== Imperative
---
var message = "Hello ";
var promptMessage = "What is your name?";
var name = prompt(promptMessage);
alert(message + name);
---
# Set some variables
# Ask the user for their name and store that to a variable
# Finally we greet them with a message including their name.
Do we see the "Proceedure" here?
_


=== Object Oriented
---
function Greeting (name) {
    this.name = name;
}
Greeting.promptMessage = "What is your name?";
Greeting.prototype.say = function (message) {
    alert(message + this.name);
}
var user = new Greeting(prompt(Greeting.promptMessage));
user.say("Hello ");
---
Here we gain some reusability, albeit with some verbosity.
# Define a "class"; see the quotes, because Javascript doesn't truly have classes.
#* Added a "static" property; that is publically available
#* Added a type-based method; prototypically inherited by all instances
# Create an instance of the "class" with an instance variable of the user's name.
# Greet the user with a message including their name.
_


=== I write a lot of non-functional Javascript
---
$.fn.ready(function () {
    $(".lookingForPlugins")
        .initializePlugin({
            myOptions: "Sea Turtles"
            ,noopCallback: function () {}
        });
});
---
Just to set you at ease, I am not a functional Javascript doyen writing everything in a functional manner. Actually, from time to time, I even write Javascript that doesn't even function.
---
function myAwesomeness (arg) {
    // do the most awesome thing to arg
    // fully unit tested
    // purely functional
}
...
myAwesomeness(); // derp derp

= SO?!
== None of that really lends itself to functional.

=== What is Functional?
    "In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data. It emphasizes the application of functions, in contrast to the imperative programming style, which emphasizes changes in state. Functional programming has its roots in lambda calculus, a formal system developed in the 1930s to investigate function definition, function application, and recursion. Many functional programming languages can be viewed as elaborations on the lambda calculus." ~~ [wikipedia(1)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
_


= That's Boring!
== Much like the design of this presentation...
_


=== What does functional mean?
* purity (referentially transparent)
* higer order functions
* functions as values
* curry-ing/partial application
* lazy evaluation
* continuations
* closures
* lexical scoping
* composition
_


=== Purity
Simple! For a value x there is a value y returned.

_


    "Programming in a functional style can also be accomplished in languages that aren't specifically designed for functional programming." ~~ [wikipedia(1)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)

We can gain some of the benefits that Functional teaches us by just working in that way - don't rely on side affects.
